# this Makefile to be where you want to get the Makefile from or you can 
# overwrite LIB_PATH_GENERAL or LIB_PATH_SAMPLE_PROGRAM.
# This design is such that if you have multiple programs, you could just set
# LIB_PATH_GENERAL to the location they should all use to find the library.
# If one program needs a different path, you would set LIB_PATH_SAMPLE_PROGRAM
# (replacing SAMPLE_PROGRAM with the appropriate name) to that different path.
